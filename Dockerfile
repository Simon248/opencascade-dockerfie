# They include the GNU debugger, g++/GNU compiler collection, and some more tools and libraries
# that are required to compile a program. For example, if you need to work on a C/C++ compiler,
# you need to install essential meta-packages on your system before starting the C compiler installation.
# When installing the build-essential packages, some other packages such as G++, dpkg-dev, GCC and make, etc.
# also install on your system.

# To run interactively on Linux, use:
# ---
# > xhost +
# > docker run --rm -ti --net=host -e DISPLAY=:0 quaoarcad/opencascade:7_4_0

# On Unix-like operating systems, the xhost command is a server access control program for X.
# In our case, access is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the list (i.e., access
# control is turned off).
#
# To run interactively on Windows, use the instruction provided
# by https://cuneyt.aliustaoglu.biz/en/running-gui-applications-in-docker-on-windows-linux-mac-hosts/
# To put it briefly, you'll need XLaunch, which is a Windows X-server. Then, notice that you'll have
# to supply it with the IP address, which you can find using `ipconfig` command. Just make sure to
# set 'Disable access control' flag in the XLaunch wizard.

# Here:
#  --rm      automatically cleans up the container from the file system when the container exits.
#   -ti      is used for interactive processes (-t for tty allocation, -i to keep stdin open).
# --net=host gives the container full access to local system services.
#  -e        sets the environment variable.
